# Pfennig

Pfennig is the Cloneable Reference Implementation of [Bitmark](/project-bitmark/bitmark), a new tested implementation using Scrypt PoW.

Pfennig benefits from being based on both the latest release of Bitmark, and the latest release of Bitcoin, with all BIPs unconditionally supported, all tests passing, and a clean code base.
